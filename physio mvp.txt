üèóÔ∏è Simplified MVP Flow

React Frontend

Home page (intro + contact info).

Services page (list of available physiotherapy services).

Booking form (choose service, pick date & time, enter name/email/phone).

Confirmation page after booking.

Node Backend (Express)

Receives booking requests.

Validates date/time (optional in MVP).

Saves booking into PostgreSQL.

Sends email/WhatsApp notification to physiotherapist (optional for MVP).

PostgreSQL Database

Just two core tables: services + appointments.

üìä PostgreSQL Tables (No Auth)
services
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
description TEXT,
price NUMERIC(10,2),
duration_minutes INT NOT NULL

appointments
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
client_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
client_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
client_phone VARCHAR(20),
service_id INT REFERENCES services(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
appointment_time TIME NOT NULL,
status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending | confirmed | cancelled
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

üöÄ API Endpoints (No Auth)

Services

GET /api/services ‚Üí list services

Appointments

POST /api/appointments ‚Üí create new booking

GET /api/appointments ‚Üí (admin dashboard later, but can skip in MVP)

‚úÖ Advantages of Skipping Auth for MVP

Less complexity (no JWT, sessions, password hashing).

Faster to deploy and test with real clients.

Clients don‚Äôt need an account ‚Üí fewer drop-offs.

Later, when you want:

Clients to manage/cancel bookings ‚Üí add auth.

Admin dashboard ‚Üí add secure login.
